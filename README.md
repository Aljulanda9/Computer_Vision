# Computer_Vision
ECSE415 Computer Vision assignments. The assignments are written in Python and use OpenCV library primarily. Other libraries such as scikit-learn are also used occasionally.

# Assignment 1
Tasks:
  - Denoise images using Gaussian, box and median filters
  - Sharpen images using Sobel filter
  - Edge detection using Sobel filter
  - Edge detection using Laplacian of Gaussian
  - Template matching using sum of squared differences (find a smaller image in a larger one). Solve the "where is waldo"     puzzle. 
  
  # Assignment 2
Tasks:
  - Stitch 3 images to form a panorama.
  - Train a nearest neighbor classifier to classify car logos.
  
  # Assignment 3
Tasks:
  - Implement algorithms for K-means and Gaussian Mixture Model to segment an image.
  - Use stereo vision techniques to estimate the depth of objects in an image.
  - Perform epipolar geometry to find matching patches in stereo images
  
  # Assignment 4
Tasks:
  - Use Prinicple Componenet Analysis to detect and identify faces.
