ECSE415 Computer Vision assignments. The assignments are written in Python and use OpenCV library primarily. Other libraries such as scikit-learn are also used occasionally.

# Assignment 1
Tasks:
  - Denoise images using Gaussian, box and median filters
  - Sharpen images using Sobel filter
  - Edge detection using Sobel filter
  - Edge detection using Laplacian of Gaussian
